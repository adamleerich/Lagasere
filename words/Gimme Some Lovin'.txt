Gimme Some Lovin'
Steve Winwood


 Well my temperature's rising and my feet are on the floor
 Twenty people knocking 'cos they're wanting some more
 Let me in baby, I don't know what you've got
 But you'd better take it easy, this place is hot
 
[Chorus:]
 I'm so glad we made it, I'm so glad we made it
 You've gotta gimme some lovin' (gimme some lovin')
 Gimme some lovin' (gimme gimme some lovin'), gimme some lovin' every day
 
Well I feel so good, everything is sounding hot
 Better take it easy 'cos the place is on fire
 Been a hard day and I don't know what to do
 Wait a minute baby, it could happen to you
 
[Chorus:]
 I'm so glad we made it, I'm so glad we made it
 You've gotta gimme some lovin' (gimme some lovin')
 Gimme some lovin' (gimme gimme some lovin'), gimme some lovin' every day
 
Well I feel so good, everybody's getting high
 Better take it easy 'cos the place is on fire
 Been a hard day and nothing went too good
 Now I'm gonna relax honey, everybody should
 
[Chorus:]
 I'm so glad we made it, I'm so glad we made it
 You've gotta gimme some lovin' (gimme some lovin')
 Gimme some lovin' (gimme gimme some lovin'), gimme some lovin' every day
 
Gimme some lovin' (gimme some lovin') I need it
 (Gimme gimme some lovin') I need it
 Ooh, gimme some lovin', every day, every day
