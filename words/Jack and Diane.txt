Jack and Diane
John Mellancamp

Little ditty about Jack and Diane
2 American kids growin' up in the heartland
Jacky's gonna be a football star
Diane debutante backseat of Jacky's car

Suckin' on a chili dog outside the tastee freeze
Diane's sittin' on Jacky's lap, he's got his hands between her knees
Jacky say, "Hey Diane lets run off behind a shady tree
Dribble off those Bobby brooks, let me do what I please"
And say a

"Oh yeah life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone"
Say, "Oh yeah life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone, now rock on"

Jacky sits back reflects his thoughts for the moment
Scratches his head and does his best James Dean
Well you know Diane, we oughtta run of the city
Diane says "Baby, you ain't missin' nothin'"
Jacky say a

"Oh yeah life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone
Oh yeah say life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone"

Gonna let it rock
Let it roll
Let the Bible belt come down
And save my soul
Hold on to 16 as long as you can
Changes come around real soon
Make us women and men

Oh yeah life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone
Oh yeah say life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone

A little ditty about Jack and Diane
Two American kids doin' the best they can
