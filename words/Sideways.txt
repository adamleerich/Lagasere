Sideways
Citizen Cope

You know it ain't easy
For these thoughts here to leave me
There's no words to describe it
In French or in English
'Cause, diamonds they fade
And flowers they bloom
And I'm telling you

These feelings won't go away
They've been knockin' me sideways
They've been knockin' me out, babe
Whenever you come around me
These feelings won't go away
They've been knockin' me sideways
I keep thinking in a moment that
Time will take them away
But these feelings won't go away

(Repeat)
