Dink's Song
Bob Dylan/Jeff Buckley

If I had wings like Noah's dove
I'd fly the river to the one I love
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well
 
If I met your man, who was long and tall
I'd hit his body like a cannon ball
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well
 
I remember one night, a drizzling rain
Round my heart I felt an achin' pain
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well
 
Muddy river runs muddy 'n' wild
You can't care the bloody for my unborn child
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well
 
One of these days and it won't be long
Call my name and I'll be gone
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well
 
Number nine train ain' done no harm
Number nine train take my poor baby home
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well
 
One of these days and it won't be long
Call my name and I'll be gone
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well
