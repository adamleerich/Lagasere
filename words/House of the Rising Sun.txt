House Of The Rising Sun
Animals

There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
It's been the ruin of many poor boy
And Lord I know I'm one

Go tell my brother Phillip
Don't do what I have done
To shun the house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun

Our mother she was a tailor
She sewed our old bluejeans
Our father he was a gambler
Way down in New Orleans

There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the death of many poor boy
And Lord I know I'm one

Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time that he's satisfied
Is when he's on a drunk

Oh mother tell your children
Not to do what I have done
To spend their life in sin and misery
In the house of the Rising Sun

With one foot on the platform
And the other foot on the train
I'm going back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain

There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the death of many poor boy
And Lord I know I'm one
