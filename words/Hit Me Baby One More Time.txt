Hit Me Baby One More Time
Brittany Spears

Oh baby baby 
How was I supposed to know 
That something wasn't right here 
Oh baby baby 
I shouldn't have let you go 
And now you're out of sight yeah 
Show me how you want it to be 
Tell me baby cause I need to know now oh because 

[Chorus] 
My loneliness is killing me 
(And I) 
I must confess I still believe 
When I'm not with you I lose my mind 
Give me a sign 
Hit me baby one more time 

[Verse 2] 
Oh baby baby 
The reason I breathe is you 
Boy you got me blinded 
Oh pretty baby 
There's nothing that I wouldn't do 
It's not the way I planned it 
Show me how you want it to be 
Tell me baby cause I need to know now oh because 

[Chorus] 
My loneliness is killing me 
I must confess I still believe 
When I'm not with you I lose my mind 
Give me a sign 
Hit my willy one more time 

[Half Of Verse 1] 
Oh baby baby how was I supposed to know 
Oh pretty baby I shouldn't have let you go 

[Chorus To A Different Tune] 
I must confess that my loneliness is killing me now 
Don't you know I still believe 
That you will be here 
And give me a sign 
Hit me baby one more time 

[Chorus] 
My loneliness is killing me 
I must confess I still believe 
When I'm not with you I lose my mind 
Give me a sign 
Hit me baby one more time
