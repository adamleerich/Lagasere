Animal
Neon Trees


Here we go again
 I kinda wanna be more than friends
 So take it easy on me
 I'm afraid
 You're never satisfied
 Here we go again
 We're sick like animals
 We play pretend
 You're just
 A cannibal
 And I'm afraid
 I won't get out alive
 I won't sleep tonight
 
Oh oh
 I want some
 More
 Oh oh
 What are you waiting for
 Take a bite of
 My heart tonight
 Oh oh
 I want some
 More
 Oh oh
 What are you waiting for
 What are you waiting for
 Say goodbye to my heart
 Tonight
 
Here we are again
 I feel the chemicals kickin' in
 It's getting heavy
 And I wanna run
 And hide
 I wanna run and hide
 I do it every time
 You're killin' me now
 And I won't be
 Denied by you
 The animal inside of you
 
Oh oh
 I want some more
 Oh oh
 What are you waiting for
 Take a bite of my heart tonight
 Oh oh
 I want some more
 Oh oh
 What are you waiting for
 What are you waiting for
 Say goodbye to my heart tonight
 
Hush, hush The world is quiet
 Hush, hush We both can't fight it
 It's us that made this mess
 Why can't you understand?
 Whoa, I won't sleep tonight
 
Here we go again [3x]
 
Oh oh
 I want some more
 Oh oh
 What are you waiting for
 Take a bite of my heart tonight
 Oh oh
 I want some more
 Oh oh
 What are you waiting for
 What are you waiting for
 What are you waiting
 
Here we go again [3x]
 Say goodbye to my heart tonight
 
Oh oh
 I want some more
 Oh oh
 What are you waiting for
 Take a bite of my heart tonight
 Oh oh
 I want some more
 Oh oh
 What are you waiting for
 What are you waiting for
 Say goodbye to my heart tonight
