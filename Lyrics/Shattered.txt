Shattered
O.A.R.


In a way, I need a change
 From this burnout scene
 Another time, another town, another everything
 But it's always back to you
 Stumble out in the night
 From the pouring rain
 Made the block, sat and thought
 There's more I need
 It's always back to you
 
But I'm good without ya
 Yeah I'm good without you
 Yeah, yeah, yeah
 
How many times can I break til I shatter?
 Over the line, can't define what I'm after
 I always turn the car around
 Give me a break; let me make my own pattern
 All that it takes is some time
 But I'm shattered
 I always turn the car around
 
I had no idea that the night
 Would take so damn long
 Took it out, on the street 
While the rain still falls
 Push me back to you
 
But I'm good without ya
 Yeah I'm good without you
 Yeah, yeah, yeah
 
How many times can I break til I shatter?
 Over the line, can't define what I'm after
 I always turn the car around
 Give me a break; let me make my own pattern
 All that it takes is some time
 But I'm shattered
 I always turn the car around
 
Give it up, give it up Baby
 Give it up, give it up now, now
 
How many times can I break til I shatter?
 Over the line, can't define what I'm after
 I always turn the car around
 All that I feel is the realness I'm faking
 Taking my time
 But its time that I'm wasting
 I always turn the car around
 
How many times can I break til I shatter?
 Over the line, can't define what I'm after
 I always turn the car around
 Don't wanna turn that car around
 I gotta turn this thing around
