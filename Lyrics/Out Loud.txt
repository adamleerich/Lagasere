Out Loud
Dispatch


Would you be the wind to blow me home
 Would you be a dream
 On the wings of a poem
 And if we were walking through a crowd
 Well you know I'd be proud
 
[Chorus:]
 If you call my name out loud
 Do you suppose that I would come running
 Do you suppose I'd come at all
 I suppose I would
 
And if we were walking
 Down a dead end street
 Would you be the one to let our eyes meet
 Or would you just keep on walking
 Down to the turn around
 'cause you know I'd be proud
 
[Chorus]
 
And if I was gone from the land we know
 Would be the dawn
 And let your beauty still show
 And if you were walking 
And heard the cold night coming
 Would you call my name
 'cause you know I'd come running
