Ophelia
The Lumineers

Oh, oh, when I was younger, oh, oh, should have known better
And I can't feel no remorse, and you don't feel nothing back

Oh, oh, got a new girlfriend, he feels like he's on top
And I don't feel no remorse, and you can't see past my blinders

Oh, Ophelia, you've been on my mind girl since the flood
Oh, Ophelia, heaven help a fool who falls in love

Oh, oh, got a little paycheck, you got big plans and you gotta move
And I don't feel nothing at all
And you can't feel nothing small

Honey I love you, that's all she wrote

Oh, Ophelia, you've been on my mind girl like a drug
Oh, Ophelia, heaven help a fool who falls in love

Oh, Ophelia, you've been on my mind girl since the flood
Oh, Ophelia, heaven help a fool who falls in love

Oh, Ophelia, you've been on my mind girl like a drug
Oh, Ophelia, heaven help a fool who falls in love
