Rumour Has It
Adele

He, he ain't real,
He ain't gonna be able to love you like I will,
He is a stranger,
You and I have history,
Or don't you remember?
Sure, he's got it all,
But, baby, is that really what you want?

Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds,
He made a fool out of you,
And, girl, he's bringing you down,
He made your heart melt,
But you're cold to the core,
Now rumour has it he ain't got your love anymore,

Rumour has it, rumour,
etc.

He, is half your age,
But I'm guessing that's the reason that you strayed,
I heard you've been missing me,
You've been telling people things you shouldn't be,
Like when we creep out and he ain't around,
Haven't you heard the rumours?

Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds,
You made a fool out of me,
And, girl, you're bringing me down,
You made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core,
But rumour has it I'm the one you're leaving him for,

Rumour has it, rumour,
etc.

All of these words whispered in my ear,
Tell a story that I cannot bear to hear,
Just 'cause I said it, it don't mean that I meant it,
People say crazy things,
Just 'cause I said it, don't mean that I meant it,
Just 'cause you heard it,

Rumour has it, rumour,
etc.

But rumour has it she's the one I'm leaving you for.
