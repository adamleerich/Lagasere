Cedar Tree
Indigo Girls

You dug a well, you dug it deep
For every wife you buried
You planted a cedar tree
The best, the best you ever had.

I stand where you stood
I stand for bad or good
And I am green and you are wood
The best, the best he ever had.

I'll dig a well, I'll dig it deep
And for my only love
I plant the cedar tree
The best, the best I'll ever have.
