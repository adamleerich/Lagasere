Ghosts That We Knew
Mumford and Sons

[Verse]
You saw my pain washed out in the rain
Broken glass, saw the blood run from my veins
But you saw no fault, no cracks in my heart
And you knelt beside my hope torn apart

[Pre Chorus/Tag]
But the ghosts that we knew will flicker from view
We'll live a long life

[Chorus]
So give me hope in the darkness that I will see the light
'Cause oh that gave me such a fright
But I will hold as long as you like
(But I will hold on with all of my might)
Just promise me we'll be alright

[Verse]
So lead me back, turn south from that place
And close my eyes to my recent disgrace
'Cause you know my call
And we'll share my all
And our children come and they will hear me roar

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
But hold me still, bury my heart on the coals
And hold me still, bury my heart next to yours

[Chorus]

[Pre Chorus/Tag]
And the ghosts that we knew will flicker from view
And we'll live a long life
