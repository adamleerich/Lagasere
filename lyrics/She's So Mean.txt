She's So Mean
Matchbox 20


I kn-kn-know a girl, she gets what she wants all the time
 'Cause she's fine
 But for an angel, she's a hot hot mess
 Make you so blind
 But you don't mind
 
'Cause she's an uptown, get-around, anything-goes girl, girl
 She's a hardcore, candy-store, gimme-some-more girl, girl
 
She'll make you take her to the club, but then she leaves with her friends
 She likes to stay late at the party, 'cause the fun never ends
 And all her clothes are on the floor and all your records are scratched
 She's like a one-way ticket 'cause you can't come back!
 
[Chorus:]
 Saying yeah... you want her, but she's so mean
 (You’ll never let her go. Why don’t you let her go?)
 Yeah... you want her, but she's so mean
 (You’ll never let her go. Why don’t you let her go?)
 
You kn-kn-know that if you don’t shut your mouth, she’ll freak out
 You better get your shit together, ‘cause she’s bringing you down now
 Yeah boy you better, you better
 'Cause she's an uptown, get-around, anything-goes girl, girl
 She's a hardcore, candy-store, gimme-some-more girl, girl
 
She’s got her wicked sense of humor, can’t believe what she says
 She drinks Bacardi in the morning ‘til it goes to her head
 And all you want is just to hold her, but she don’t go for that
 She has a hard time coming when she can’t hit back
 
[Chorus]
 
Every now and then, she makes you just a little bit crazy
 She’ll turn a knife into your back and then she’s calling you baby, crazy
 
She'll make you take her to the club, but then she leaves with her friends
 She likes to stay late at the party, 'cause the fun never ends
 And all her clothes are on the floor and all your records are scratched
 She's like a one-way ticket 'cause you can't come back!
 
[Chorus x2]
