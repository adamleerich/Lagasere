Make Them Hear You
Ragtime

go out and tell the story.
let it echo far and wide.
make them hear you.
make them hear you.

how that justice was our battle and how justice was denied.
make them hear you.
make them hear you.

and say to those who blame us
for the way we chose to fight
that sometimes there are battles 
which are more than black or white.

and i could not put down my sword 
when justice was my right.
make them hear you.
make them hear you.

my path may lead to heaven or hell
and god will say what's best
but one thing he will never say
is that i went quietly to my rest.

go out and tell our story
to your daughters and your sons.
make them hear you.
make them hear you.

proclaim it from your pulpit.
in your classroom with your pen
teach every child to raise his voice
and then, my brothers, then

will justice be demanded
by ten million righteous men.
make them hear you.
when they hear you
i'll be near you again.
